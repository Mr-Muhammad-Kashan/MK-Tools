--- ‚ú® NEW FEATURES ---

-   **Automatic Update Checker**: The application now automatically checks for new
    versions on startup without impacting performance. A notification will appear
    if an update is available.
-   **Group Policy Editor Module**: A new "Group Policy" section has been added,
    allowing users to apply a curated set of optimized system policies for
    enhanced privacy and performance with a single click. (Not available on
    Windows Home editions).

--- üöÄ IMPROVEMENTS & OPTIMIZATIONS ---

-   **100% Accurate Cache Cleaning**: The "Clean Cache" module has been completely
    overhauled. It now uses a high-performance PowerShell engine to calculate
    folder sizes, ensuring the "space cleaned" metric is perfectly accurate.
-   **Enhanced Auditory Feedback**: The hover sound effect system has been upgraded
    to a stateful protocol, preventing repetitive sound "spam" when moving the
    mouse over interactive elements.

--- üõ†Ô∏è BUG FIXES ---

-   **Startup Stability**: Fixed a critical race condition that could occur during
    the splash screen's pre-flight checks, ensuring a 100% stable application launch.
-   **UI Layout Integrity**: Resolved a visual glitch where the side Navigation Rail
    would unexpectedly resize when the scrollbar in the main content area appeared
    or disappeared.
