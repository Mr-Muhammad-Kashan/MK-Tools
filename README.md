## ‚ú® Key Features

MK-Tools is organized into several powerful modules, each targeting a specific aspect of your Windows experience.

### üöÄ Performance Tweaks
Unleash your PC‚Äôs full potential by optimizing core system and hardware settings. Reduce CPU load, improve resource allocation, and enhance stability for gaming and professional applications.

| Feature                               | Description                                                              |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Disable Fast Startup** | Ensures a full, clean shutdown every time, improving long-term stability and hardware compatibility. |
| **Disable Compressed Memory** | Reduces background CPU usage on systems with 16GB+ RAM, preventing micro-stutters. |
| **Hardware-Accelerated GPU Scheduling** | Allows your GPU to manage its own VRAM, potentially reducing latency in games and creative apps. |
| **Prioritize Foreground Applications** | Allocates more CPU resources to your active application for a smoother, more responsive experience. |
| **Optimize SvcHost Splitting** | Forces services into separate processes on high-RAM systems, improving stability and making it easier to identify resource hogs. |

### üé® UI & Responsiveness
Customize the Windows user interface to make it faster, cleaner, and more efficient. Remove artificial delays and restore classic, functional UI elements.

| Feature                               | Description                                                              |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Enable Classic Right-Click Menu** | Restores the full Windows 10 context menu on Windows 11, removing the "Show more options" extra click. |
| **Instant Menu Display** | Removes the 400ms animation delay, making all context menus and drop-downs appear instantly. |
| **100% JPEG Wallpaper Quality** | Prevents Windows from compressing your desktop wallpaper, ensuring a pixel-perfect, crisp image. |
| **Disable Web Search in Start Menu** | Limits Start Menu searches to your local files and apps, improving privacy and search speed. |

### üõ†Ô∏è Fix Windows
A powerful diagnostic and repair center to ensure the integrity of your core operating system files.

| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Scan (SFC)** | Runs the System File Checker (`sfc /scannow`) to find and repair corrupted protected system files automatically. |
| **Advanced Scan (DISM)** | Runs the Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool (`DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth`) to repair the underlying component store that SFC relies on. This is the ultimate tool for fixing deep system corruption. |

### üßπ Clean Cache
Reclaim gigabytes of disk space and improve system performance by safely clearing out temporary and cached files from various system locations.

| Feature                               | Description                                                              |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## üèõÔ∏è Architectural Blueprint

MK-Tools is engineered from the ground up for stability, performance, and security. It operates as a single, self-contained Python application, ensuring all logic and assets are perfectly synchronized.

-   **Entry Point**: The application begins with the `PrivilegeManager`, which uses the standard Windows UAC prompt to ensure the necessary administrative rights for system modification.
-   **Core Engine**: The main `App` class orchestrates all components. It launches a non-blocking, animated `SplashScreen` while running asynchronous pre-flight checks in the background. This ensures the main UI is only revealed once all system states have been audited, providing an instantaneous, ready-to-use experience.
-   **UI Framework**: Built on **CustomTkinter**, providing a modern, themeable, and high-performance graphical interface.
-   **DPI & Scaling**: The `ScreenManager` and `Theme` engine work in tandem to provide full DPI awareness. The UI and all fonts are dynamically scaled based on the system's display settings, ensuring a flawless visual experience from 720p to 4K.
-   **Auditory Feedback**: A singleton `SoundManager`, powered by **Pygame**, provides a rich, non-blocking auditory experience for all user interactions, with a global toggle for user control.
-   **Tweak Logic**: Each system tweak is managed by a dedicated, decoupled backend controller class. These controllers interface directly with the Windows Registry and execute PowerShell commands, containing no UI code and ensuring a perfect separation of concerns.
-   **Process Integrity**: All long-running operations (e.g., `sfc /scannow`) are executed in separate processes. The main `App` class maintains a central process registry, guaranteeing that all child processes are gracefully terminated upon application shutdown, leaving a zero-footprint exit.
